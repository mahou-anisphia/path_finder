# Simple Project

This is a simple Python project that implements various path finding algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.7 or later. You can check your Python version by running:
  ```
  python --version
  ```
- You have installed `pip` (Python package installer). It usually comes with Python installation.

## Setting up the project

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mahou-anisphia/path_finder.git
   cd simple-project
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your project. Here's how you can set it up:

   ```
   # Create a new virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS and Linux:
   # source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   When the virtual environment is activated, you'll see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

3. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist yet, you can create it after installing your dependencies using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

You have now set up the project environment and are ready to start developing!
